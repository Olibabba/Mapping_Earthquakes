# Mapping_Earthquakes

This website pulls in live data from the USGS (U.S. Geological Survey -- https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php) and will display one of three recent earthquake data sets:
- All earthquakes in the last week
- Major earthquakes in the last week
- Significant earthquakes in the last month

I was annoyed that the legend did not always match up with the quake layer, so functionality was added to show or hide the legend based on which layer is selected.
